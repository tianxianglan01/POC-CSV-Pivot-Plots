# Mission Control Data Analysis Proof of Concept

#### Script Notes:
- script_first_transformation outputs csvs to /raw_and_cleaned_data/Output Csvs Script Tests
- script_second_transformation prob 2 outputs to /Output_Graphs/top_ten_severe_events_states.jepg
- script_second_transformation prob 3 outputs to /Output_Graphs/2nd Trans Prob 3

#### Output_Graphs:
- contains the graphs outputted by our scripts: ergo the outputs of our POC

#### Jupyter Notebook Notes:
- if you'd like to see the notebooks for how the script works, please use the JN - 'Title'.ipynb files

#### raw_and_cleaned_data
- 3 partitions are the 3 datasets from the original kaggle dataset
- Output Csvs are the csvs that were outputted from the jupyter noteoboks
- Output Csvs Script Tests are the csvs that came out from the scripts
